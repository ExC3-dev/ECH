## Instuctions: 
You use it by opening any level you like and runing the script, and then you enter your words per minute and let it run. It also can play all the games and cycle through, however it does not work on the pea shooter game. You can run this in the background or in another tab.
> [!WARNING]
>If you set the WPM to high it will lag or "crash" and stop typing club until you refresh. and it will stop eventually so you cant have it just sit at home getting a higher score and finnish it.
